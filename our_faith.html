<h3><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, and if children, then heirs—heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him."</strong></span></h3>
<span style="color: #000000;"> </span> Romans 8:16,17

<span style="color: #000000;">Green is the color of Pentecost in the Orthodox Church. It represents the fullness of Life that comes with the Holy Spirit who was given to the Church, and so to the world, in order that God might always be in our midst, filling our broken lives with an ever-present relationship that draws us into the Father's love. This was the fulfillment of Christ's bearing the entire weight of sin and death, that after His Resurrection, and Ascension to His Father's presence, we might be given the presence of God which Christ has always possessed as God from eternity. The Holy Spirit is the 'Lover of Mankind' who looks at every human being and calls each one to receive the only true Life, that we might be 'filled with all the fullness of God' (Eph. 3:19).</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">This is the faith of the Orthodox Christian Church, and this is the Mystery we participate in at Holy Pentecost, and indeed which is offered to us every moment of our lives.</span>
