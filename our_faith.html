<h3><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>“I am the Resurrection and the Life. Whoever believes in Me, though he die, yet shall he live, and everyone who lives and believes in Me shall never die."</strong></span></h3>
<span style="color: #000000;"> </span> John 11:25-26

<span style="color: #000000;">White is the color of Resurrection in the Orthodox Church. It represents the never-ending brightness, joy, and life brought into this broken world by the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, who, as 'The Lover of Mankind', took upon Himself the entire weight of sin and death that we human beings had chosen freely in desiring a life apart from God more than a life in love with God.  Death is one thing that faces every one of us.  But the only real freedom from death, given to us as a gift even now and forever, is in He who died for one purpose: that we might live with Him in joy forever.  If we give our lives to Him without restraint, "death has no dominion over us" (Romans 6).

<span style="color: #000000;">This is the faith of the Orthodox Christian Church, and this is the Mystery we participate in at Great and Holy Pascha (Easter), and indeed which is offered to us every moment of our lives.</span>
