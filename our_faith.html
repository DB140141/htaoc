<h3><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>"And they clothed him in a purple cloak, and twisting together a crown of thorns, they put it on him." Mark 15:17</strong></span></h3>
<h3><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>"Her priests will I clothe with salvation, and her saints with rejoicing shall rejoice . . . His enemies will I clothe with shame, but upon Him shall My sanctification flourish." Psalm 132:18</strong></span></h3>

<span style="color: #000000;">Purple is the color of Lent in the Orthodox Church. As the quotes from Holy Scripture above represent, this color points to the suffering of Jesus Christ our Savior for our salvation, as 'The Lover of Mankind', as we put it in our Orthodox worship. Yet in this same suffering, we also see the sign and promise of His eternal victory as the King who is 'clothed with majesty' (Ps. 73), and who in His suffering 'draws all people to Himself' in His victorious death. He was clothed in the broken shame of human sin in order to <b><i>pour out upon us</i></b> the eternal Love of His Father.</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">This is the faith of the Orthodox Christian Church, and this is the Mystery we participate in during Great Lent.</span>
