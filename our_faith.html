<h3><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>"The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; those who dwelt in a land of deep darkness, on them has light shone."</strong></span></h3>
<span style="color: #000000;"> </span> Isaiah 9:2

<span style="color: #000000;">Red is the color of Nativity in the Orthodox Church. This color is a representation of divinity, and for Christmas, it is the representation of the light of divinity filling the world that had dwelt in darkness, awaiting to Son of Man. And so out of the darkness of winter, the coldness of a world without God, comes the "uncreated Light" of God, as we say in the Orthodox Church.</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">But why should we need the darkness and the cold to understand this great light, and why should we (as we do) fast as we await the Feast of Christ's birth? It is because we can only understand the great light of God if we understand what it would be like without Him: cold, dark, and without hope. The darkness would truly be the end. But as Christians, the Savior's birth is the gateway to the unending and all-encompassing love of God. It is the revelation, above all, that the human world first sees with its own eyes the beginning of the victory over darkness at Christmas, which will be fulfilled in the ultimate victory over the darkness of death in the Death and Resurrection of the Son of God, Immanuel.</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">This is the faith of the Orthodox Christian Church, and this is the Mystery we participate in at Holy Nativity (Christmas) and indeed which is offered to us every moment of our lives.</span>
