“And they clothed him in a purple cloak, and twisting together a crown of thorns, they put it on him.” Mark 15:17 “Her priests will I clothe with salvation, and her saints with rejoicing shall rejoice . . . His enemies will I clothe with shame, but upon Him shall My sanctification flourish.” Psalm 132:18
